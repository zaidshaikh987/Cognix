> A domain-agnostic, uncertainty-aware multi-agent AI research framework.

COGNIX is a framework designed to evaluate decision-making in Multi-Agent AI systems under conditions of distributional shift and sensor degradation. It provides a modular architecture for quantifying uncertainty (Epistemic vs. Aleatoric), fusing multi-agent beliefs, and generating calibrated, risk-aware decisions.

## 🏗️ 1. Framework Architecture

COGNIX is not a monolithic script, but a decoupled, dependency-injected framework built around strict API contracts. The core `DecisionEngine` coordinates the pipeline without depending on concrete algorithmic implementations.

The framework is divided into pluggable interfaces:
- **`AgentInterface`**: Standardizes agent predictions and uncertainty estimations (`PredictionResult` and `UncertaintyResult`).
- **`GraphRefinement`**: Handles inter-agent communication and attention routing (e.g., `StandardGAT`, `EpistemicGAT`, `NoGraph`).
- **`BeliefFuser`**: Implements belief fusion strategies (e.g., `EpistemicWeightedFusion`, `AverageFusion`).
- **`Calibrator`**: Enforces post-hoc calibration via Inductive Conformal Prediction.
- **`AttributionMethod`**: Explains decision contributions (e.g., `EpistemicShapley`).
- **`RiskStrategy`**: Maps calibrated uncertainties to actionable escalation levels.
- **`TransportInterface`**: Minimal abstraction for distributed multi-agent deployment.

## 🔬 2. Research Mechanism

The central research mechanism evaluated by COGNIX flows as follows:

```text
    epistemic uncertainty
            ↓
    epistemic prior
            ↓
    GAT attention
            ↓
    collective multi-agent belief
            ↓
    conformal calibration
            ↓
    risk-aware decision
            ↓
    attribution / escalation
```

By explicitly isolating **epistemic uncertainty** (model ignorance or out-of-distribution shift), COGNIX provides a mechanism to reduce the prior influence of degraded agents before the network graph routes attention, potentially improving the reliability of the fused belief.

## 📊 3. Experimental Evidence

COGNIX is evaluated under a rigorous benchmarking infrastructure (Phase B). In the tested synthetic conditions:

- **Epistemic vs Standard Attention**: Ablation studies provide evidence that injecting an epistemic prior materially changes the attention redistribution of the GAT relative to a standard learned attention mechanism.
- **Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) Shift**: Observed in the tested conditions, epistemic-weighted fusion reduced the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to uniform weighting when targeted agents were subjected to severe covariate shift.
- **Fail-Loud Research Integrity**: The pipeline strictly enforces a fail-loud behavior in research mode (e.g., rejecting fallback values when uncertainty decomposition fails), guaranteeing mathematically sound provenance for all reported metrics.

*Note: The magnitude of these effects depends heavily on the training quality of the agents and the severity of the distributional shift.*

## 🎯 4. Research Targets

The ongoing development of COGNIX targets the following scientific objectives:
- Demonstrating behavioral substitutability across multiple non-automotive domains (e.g., tabular classification, distributed sensor networks).
- Expanding the conformal calibration pipeline to map empirical coverage under severe, non-exchangeable distribution shifts.
- Benchmarking the latency and exact vs. approximate runtime of Epistemic Shapley attribution as the number of agents $N$ scales.
- Evaluating resilience against conflicting agents and communication dropouts via the distributed `TransportInterface`.

## ⚠️ 5. Limitations

COGNIX is an early-stage research framework. Users must be aware of the following:
- **No Physical Safety Guarantees**: COGNIX does not guarantee safety. Conformal prediction provides empirical coverage *only* under strict calibration and exchangeability assumptions, which do not hold universally under arbitrary OOD shift.
- **No Superiority Claims**: COGNIX does not universally outperform baselines. Its mechanisms are highly dependent on the quality of the underlying MC-Dropout or Deep Ensemble uncertainty estimations.
- **Latency**: COGNIX makes no claims of "real-time" performance. Online latency for MC-Dropout, GAT inference, and exact Shapley enumeration must be explicitly measured for your specific hardware and batch size constraints.
- **Approximate Mathematics**: Uncertainty decomposition relies on approximations (e.g., Bernoulli predictive-variance decomposition) that may degrade under certain model architectures.

## 🚀 6. Example Usage

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zaidshaikh987/Cognix.git
cd Cognix

# Install the framework
pip install -e .
```

### Dependency Injection Pipeline

```python
from cognix.engine.decision_engine import DecisionEngine
from cognix.config.schema import CognixConfig
from cognix.graph.epistemic_gat import EpistemicGAT
from cognix.belief.fusion import EpistemicWeightedFusion
from cognix.calibration.conformal import ConformalPredictor

# Initialize explicit strategies
config = CognixConfig()
gat = EpistemicGAT(input_dim=3, hidden_dim=8, output_dim=1)
fuser = EpistemicWeightedFusion()
calibrator = ConformalPredictor()

# Inject into the DecisionEngine
engine = DecisionEngine(
    config=config,
    belief=fuser,
    graph=gat,
    calibrator=calibrator,
    mode="research" # Fails loud on mathematically invalid states
)

# Agents must implement the AgentInterface
agents = [radar_agent, camera_agent, lidar_agent]

# Evaluate the pipeline
result = engine.decide(agents, input_data)

print(f"Fused Prediction: {result.confidence}")
print(f"Total Uncertainty: {result.total_uncertainty}")
```

### Running Automated Benchmarks

COGNIX supports automated, multi-seed ablation benchmarking:

```bash
python -m cognix.evaluation.run \
    --config configs/benchmark/gat_ablation.yaml \
    --output-dir results/gat_ablation/
```
